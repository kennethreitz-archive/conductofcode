The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python!
=================================

Welcome to The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python. **DON'T PANIC!**

**This guide is currently under heavy development, and is mostly a skeleton at the moment.**  If you'd like to help, `fork us on GitHub <https://github.com/kennethreitz/python-guide>`_!

This *opinionated* guide exists to provide both novice and expert Python developers a best-practice handbook to the installation, configuration, and usage of Python on a daily basis.
