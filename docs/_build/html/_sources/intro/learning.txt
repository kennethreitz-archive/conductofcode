Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Think Python attempts to give an introduction to basic concepts in computer science through the 
use of the python language. The focus was to create a book with plenty of exercises, minimal jargon and 
a section in each chapter devoted to the subject of debugging.

While exploring the various features available in the python language the author weaves in various design
patterns and best practices. 

The book also includes several case studies which have the reader explore the topics discussed in the book 
in greater detail by applying those topics to real-world examples. Case studies include assignments in GUI
and Markov Analysis.
