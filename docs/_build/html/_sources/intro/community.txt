The Community
=============

BDFL
----

Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, is often referred to as the BDFL â€” the Benevolent Dictator For Life.



Python Software Foundation
--------------------------

The mission of the Python Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language, and to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international community of Python programmers.

PEPs
----

PEPs are *Python Enhancement Proposals*. They describe changes to Python itself, or the standards around it.

There are three different types of PEPs (as defined by `PEP1 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/>`_):

    **Standards**
        Describes a new feature or implementation.

    **Informational**
        Describes a design issue, general guidelines, or information to the community.

    **Process**
        Describes a process related to Python.


Notable PEPs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a few PEPs that could be considered required reading:

- `PEP8 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_: The Python Style Guide.
    Read this. All of it. Follow it.

- `PEP20 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/>`_: The Zen of Python.
    A list of 19 statements that briefly explain the philosophy behind Python.

- `PEP257 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/>`_: Docstring Conventions.
    Gives guidelines for semantics and conventions associated with Python docstrings.

You can read more at `The PEP Index <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/>`_.

Submitting a PEP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 PEPs are peer-reviewed and accepted/rejected after much discussion. Anyone can write and submit a PEP for review.

 Here's an overview of the PEP acceptance workflow:

Python Conferences 
--------------------------

The major events for the Python community are developer conferences. The two most notable conferences are PyCon, which is held in the US, and its European sibling, EuroPython.

A comprehensive list of conferences is maintained `at pycon.org <http://www.pycon.org/>`_.


Python User Groups
--------------------------

User Groups are where a bunch of Python developers meet to present or talk about Python topics of interest. A list of local user groups is maintained at the `Python Software Foundation Wiki <http://wiki.python.org/moin/LocalUserGroups>`_.
