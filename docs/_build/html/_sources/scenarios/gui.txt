GUI Applications
================


Qt
::
Qt is a cross-platform application framework that is widely used for developing software with a GUI but can also be used for non-GUI applications.

WXPython

Install (Stable)
----------------
*Go to http://www.wxpython.org/download.php#stable and download the appropriate package for your OS.*

Gtk
:::
PyGTK provides Python bindings for the GTK+ toolkit. Like the GTK+ library
itself, it is currently licensed under the GNU LGPL. It is worth noting that
PyGTK only currenty supports the Gtk-2.X API (NOT Gtk-3.0). It is currently
recommended that PyGTK is not used for new projects and existing applications be
ported from PyGTK to PyGObject.

Tk
::
Tkinter is a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tcl/Tk. It has the advantage
of being included with the Python standard library, making it the most
convenient and compatible toolkit to program with.

Both Tk and Tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, as well as on Windows
and Macintosh systems. Starting with the 8.0 release, Tk offers native look and
feel on all platforms.

There's a good multi-language Tk tutorial with Python examples at
`TkDocs <http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/index.html>`_. There's more information
available on the `Python Wiki <http://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter>`_.
